# Process Engineering Basics - Practicals

This repository contains projects for Process Engineering Basics, which is a course I follow at Wageningen University & Research as part of my Bachelor Biosystems Engineering. Each practical uses an Arduino in combination with sensors to measure process data.

### 🌡️ [LAB1 – Temperature sensor](temperature-sensor/)

In this lab, a DS18B20 temperature sensor is used to measure temperatures with an Arduino. The data is displayed on an OLED screen and logged via a Python script in a CSV file.
